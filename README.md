# OgarII

Your friendly agar.io private server recreation.

- It supports all current agar.io protocol versions (4 - 20).

- It supports handling multiple worlds, all within one instance. Be wary that you can still use up the one CPU core node.js is running on.

- It has a minimal memory footprint, and strictly uses uWebSockets for networking.

- The code uses JSDoc to specify types. Understanding what the code does is down to your understanding of English.

- It is customizable for your quality of life even without plugins, which are about to come soon.
